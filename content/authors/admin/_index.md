I'm John Karanja, a passionate professional with a diverse background in freelancing, training, and data analytics. 

My journey began in freelance writing and tutoring, where I honed my research and synthesis skills, helping students master complex topics and excel in their studies. Eager to equip others with digital skills, I transitioned to being a Digital Skills Trainer, using my training expertise and tech fluency to empower individuals and organizations to thrive in the digital landscape.

Driven by a thirst for knowledge and a knack for identifying patterns, I embraced the world of data analytics. As a Data Analyst, I leverage my analytical skills and data-driven mindset to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, contributing to informed decision-making and effective strategic planning. I am interested in using advanced analytics on big data using SQL, R, pandas, numpy and scikit learn to provide cutting edge solutions to business problems.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm passionate about fostering learning and collaborating with individuals who share a love for continuous growth and innovation. Whether you're looking to expand your digital skillset, uncover hidden insights in your data, or simply connect with a like-minded individual, I'd love to hear from you!
